              <p>
                I’m currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp at Rithm and actively learning to code. <br>
                <br>
                Previously, I co-founded and ran a pharma-tech startup. I led a team that created and delivered an user based app and back-end software that aimed to deliver a more simple and streamlined solution for patients, pharmacists and other health collaborators to manage medication therapy. It was this experience, working alongside developpers, creating a product that can improve lives, that has led to follow the path I am taking today to learn coding.<br>
                <br>
                Prior to my career pivot, my professional background was in pharmacy, where I’ve worked in clinic for nearly 5 years. During that time, I was in charge of staff training, prospective pharmacy graduate mentorships and  other health-initiative projects.
